# Image-Drawer
This project was assigned by Dr. Catherine Welsh. 

The program draws pictures according to sequences of (x, y) coordinates read from a text file. 
At the end, it then allows users to create their own drawing through reading input from mouse clicks. 

It requires cs1graphics.py and simplegraphics.py to run which were provided by Dr. Welsh.
